<h1>Sheep and Rams</h1>

Player against computer game. The goal is a number to be guessed with minimal tries. The computer prints the matches after every try:

- If there are matches in the players number at the right places, they are rams
- If there are matches in the players number but they are mixed, they are sheep

For example: 2567 -> 6578 : 1 ram 2 sheep
